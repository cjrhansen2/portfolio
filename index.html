      <h1>Bio</h1>
      <p>I am a PhD student in Integrated Systems Engineering at Ohio State, currently funded for full-time human factors engineering research in the field of healthcare within the Wexner Medical Center. My research interests involve the study and application of machine learning algorithms to aid in identifying at-risk cohorts of patients, particularly those dealing with critical respiratory and cardiac issues as well as expectant mothers. I am interested in assessing the qualities of machine learning models that are integral for their application into high-risk real-work human systems, such as usability, transparency, and interpretability. I previously worked as a Product Specialist at Qualtrics, working with customers to create individualized solutions through the Qualtrics Experience Platform for their business and research needs. Before that I was a programmer and analyst for the HAWC+ Instrument Analysis Team, writing analytical scripts in Python for the process of the data pipeline. These programs reduced raw incoming data from the SOFIA Airborne Observatory into useable astronomical images.</p>
      <p>I completed my undergraduate degree at Northwestern University with a bachelor of arts in Physics and a concentration in Astronomy. As an undergrad I worked in a research group that studies the relation between galactic magnetic fields and star formation. I won the best senior thesis award for my work in this group. In the past I've conducted research on the climates of extrasolar planets as well as spectral analysis of solar flares within the solar chromosphere. I also was president of the Society of Physics Students and wrote for Science in Society, an online publication through Northwestern that seeks to make scientific concepts accessible to the public. </p>
      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <h2>Simple Scheduler</h2><a href="https://cjrhansen2.github.io/SimpleSchedule/">(App,</a><a href="https://github.com/cjrhansen2/SimpleSchedule"> Repo)</a>
      <p>This website serves as practice for using jQuery and third party APIs. In this project I use luxon, a third party API for getting the current time and date. This is a simple scheduler for a single day. It is updated based on what hour of the day it is currently, showing description boxes in different colors depending whether it is in the past, present, or future. You can refresh the page after saving events and they will still be there, as they are saved in the localStorage.</p>
      <h2>Beds 'n Brews</h2><a href="https://maniac-i.github.io/Beds-N-Brews/">(App,</a><a href="https://github.com/Maniac-i/Beds-N-Brews"> Repo)</a>
      <p>This app is a group project utilizing third party APIs for a clean and finished webpage. This page allows travelers to look for hotels and breweries in cities that they plan to visit. I focused primarily on hotel API functionality and event listeners.</p>
      <h2>MovieChat</h2><a href="https://github.com/rhubble1987/project-2">(App,</a><a href="https://dry-retreat-28043.herokuapp.com/"> Repo)</a>
      <p>This app is another group project with more of a back-end focus. The app affords the creation of movie watch parties with friends and implements a chat feature while watching movies using Socket.io</p>
